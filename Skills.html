                                                    Throughout my life I have participated in various leadership postitions and 
                                                    jobs that have grown and refined my ability to connect with others. In highshool 
                                                    I participated in team sports, AP class, marching band and other clubs/groups. I 
                                                    feel as though these experiences have helped me to have good connections in the workplace, 
                                                    with clients, and networking throughout my personal career.

                                                <li> 
                                                    I know the importance of showing up and being involved even when it isn't the most convenient.
                                                    I am currently on the BYU Womens Rugby team. It is a huge sacrifice on time but each one of these girls 
                                                    including me are dedicated to helping eachother get better and supporting eachother outside of practice as well. 
                                                    I know the importance of working together with other people and creating lasting relationships.
